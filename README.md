This program created by Morphax.

This program can work with keyboards that work lights with the scrollock key

Tested keyboard : Piranha 2355

You can sync the lights with that program.

You can add switch sound to your keyboard.

You can lock the windows key for the gaming.

Also there is video that i introduce the program.

Good luck.
